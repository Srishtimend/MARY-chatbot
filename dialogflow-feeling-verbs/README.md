If the user were to say "I am elated" or "I feel energetic", or something along those lines, we would what to provide an appropriate response question for excitement, such as "it's great you feel alive, what's up?"

We choose the Dialogflow because it is easy to prototype and get started on. Here's a link to the live demo Dialogflow Bot if is still up: https://bot.dialogflow.com/c2711896-01f6-4328-9544-c8194daf340e.
We have also added the source code in this folder for reference.
